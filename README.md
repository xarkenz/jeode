# Jeode Engine

## Usage

To use the Jeode library in your own project, add the following to the HTML structure:

```html
<script src="https://combinatronics.com/xarkenz/jeode/main/src/jeode.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

This will import the Jeode library from GitHub for use in your own scripts.
Keep in mind, this script must be loaded __before__ any code that uses it, so place the `<script>` tag(s) containing your game code __after__ this one.

Once you have access to the Jeode library, see [documentation](https://github.com/xarkenz/jeode/wiki/Documentation) for the next steps.
